We need to infer the transformation rule from the examples equations:

- eq[1]: >#+>| = #%
- eq[2]: %?+$< = >|$
- eq[3]: |/^%| = |/%|
- eq[4]: %?+'# = >#/

Operand symbols: >, #, |, %, ?, $, <, /, '

Operator symbols: +, ^

And use the transformation rules to find the answer for **question lhs**: '>+>$

Notice it is possible to deduce the hidden transformation using the example equations and question lhs as contraints:

Let's first try an easy pattern concatenation forward or reverse pattern.

The equations that share the same symbol than the question lhs are: eq[1], eq[2], eq[3]

- eq[1]: a concat forward pattern AB op CD = ABCD <check>
- eq[2]: no concat forward pattern or reverse concat pattern <cross>. Stop inmediatly, the rule doesn't apply.

{NOTE: if all the equation that share the same symbol pass the check. Then, we can use that rule and deduce the answer inmediatly}

Then, the easy concatenation pattern is not possible. Let's try a more sophisticate pattern recognition:

Let's assume that there is a transformation rule tuple given by:
- digit mapping: sending each operand symbol to a unique digit (no two symbols share a digit)
- operator mapping: sending each operator symbol to one arithmetic operation (several operations may fit, but only one is ultimately used).
- a magnitude encoding: the operands can be decoded following two strategies, abbreviated std and le below:
    - `standard` (std): AB = A x base + B
    - `little_endian` (le): AB = B x base + A (a digit swap after standard decode)
- a base: the system is encoded in a given base. Let's use base 10 always for simplicity.

Then, if the transformation rule tuple satisfied all the equations (including the question lhs), we can use the program to find the answer.

Let's try to find this pattern by taking an heuristic approach. If after some tries, we can't find the solution, we can return our best guess.

Let's define some possible operator candidates for any operator symbol:

- add(a, b) = a + b + offset, offset in {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2}
- sub_signed(a, b) = a - b
- rsub_signed(a, b) = b - a
- mul(a, b) = a x b + offset, offset in {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2}
- absdiff(a, b) = |a - b| + offset, offset in {-2, -1, 0, +1, +2}
- neg_absdiff(a, b) = -|a - b|
- gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b)
- lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b) if (a and b) else 0
- fdiv(a, b) = a // b if b != 0
- mod(a, b) = a % b if b != 0
- rmod(a, b) = b % a
- concat_fwd(a, b) = a x 10^(digits of b) + b
- concat_rev(a, b) = b x 10^(digits of a) + a

Now, let's analyze the operator symbols one by one and make factual observations based on the form of the equations to discard infeasible candidates:

Observation for '+':
- {observation 1}
- {observation 2}
- {observation 3}

Remaining candidates for `+`:
  add, mul, absdiff, gcd, lcm, fdiv, mod, rmod

Observation for '^':

Remaining candidates for `+`:
